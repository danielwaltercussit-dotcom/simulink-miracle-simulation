# Simulink Power Electronics

Use this skill for Simulink/Simscape Electrical power-electronics work:
model inspection, waveform/control debugging, schematic layout, validation, and
user-approved corpus self-improvement. Keep conclusions grounded in inspected
block paths, logged signals, simulations, and numeric checks.

## Core Workflow

1. At the start of a session, look for and use the local `superpowers`
   skill or other skill which has a likely name when it is installed. It is valuable process guidance for selecting
   and sequencing other skills; user instructions still take precedence.
2. Classify by domain, topology, and control objective.
3. Load only the narrow context needed: usually `references/workflow.md`, one
   domain subskill, and one triggered reference.
4. Prefer MATLAB MCP and Simulink Agentic Toolkit evidence. If model tools are
   unavailable, continue only with file/document/script review and report that
   model-level inspection or validation is blocked.
5. Track validation state explicitly: `opened`, `compiled`, `simulated`,
   `measured`.

## Lean Loading Rules

- Treat this root file as a **router**, not a handbook.
- Do not bulk-load README, every reference, or every subskill.
- Read platform and MCP setup details only when tool status is uncertain.
- Only run corpus/self-improvement work when the user explicitly allows this
  skill to self-iterate.
- When self-iteration is enabled, promote new notes only when they are grounded
  in official sources, inspected models, or repeatable validation.

## Read When Needed

- `references/domain-map.md` to choose the subskill.
- `references/workflow.md` for inspect -> diagnose -> edit -> validate.
- `references/model-standards.md` before editing PE models.
- `references/layout-patterns-from-examples.md` and
  `references/simscape-layout.md` for generated or repaired Simscape
  schematics, especially when plant, control, measurement, and scope wiring
  make the top level hard to read.
- `references/control-algorithm-debugging.md` for control tracing,
  PI/feedforward, and P/Q checks.
- `references/simulink-command-line-sop.md` for command-line simulation and
  output reading.
- `references/mcp-simulink-troubleshooting.md` for supported platform, MCP
  dependency, or tool discovery questions.
- `references/companion-skills.md` when asked about optional external skills,
  including `using-superpowers`.
- `references/output-standards.md` before reports.
- `references/capability-map.md` only when asked about scope.
- `references/self-iteration-loop.md` and `references/example-derived-patterns.md`
  for user-approved corpus/self-improvement.
- Use `model-fidelity-selector` when the PE question could be answered by
  RMS/phasor, averaged EMT, switching EMT, modal, impedance, or hybrid models.
- Use `small-signal-modal-analysis` for eigenvalue, damping, participation, or
  controller-interaction questions.
- Use `weak-grid-scr-scenario` for SCR/ESCR, low system strength, and
  fault/line-contingency stress matrices.
- Use `gfl-gfm-control-comparison` for fair PLL/GFL versus VSG/droop/GFM
  comparisons.
- Use `ibr-model-validation-evidence` when model credibility or handoff
  evidence is the goal.
- `subskills/three-phase-grid-inverter/SKILL.md` for active grid-inverter work.
- Treat other `subskills/*/SKILL.md` files as evidence guides until populated.
- Use Simulink Agentic Toolkit or model-based-design skills for generic build,
  edit, simulate, and test mechanics; use this skill for PE-specific routing
  and evidence rules.
- Use `assets/` templates when output needs a project README or diagnostic
  report.

## Operating Rules

- Inspect before editing: active/reference paths, commented subsystems,
  From/Goto routing, sample times, solver settings, measurement polarity, and
  generated artifacts.
- For control defects, trace backward level by level from modulation output to
  raw measurements.
- Parameters have physical meaning. Do not fit a ratio to hide line/phase
  voltage, transform, sign, or unit errors.
- For Simscape layout, classify nodes before drawing and keep common/return
  nodes local.
- When generating or rebuilding models, prefer visible block-and-connection
  structure over hiding complex plant or controller relationships inside one
  large MATLAB Function block. Use functions only for small, well-contained
  algorithms or when the user explicitly asks for script/function generation.
- Before declaring that a PE model is "accurate", name the chosen fidelity and
  the dynamics it excludes. If the study is about weak-grid damping, fault
  recovery, protection, harmonics, or GFL/GFM control choice, route through the
  corresponding project skill before accepting the result.
- For block-heavy PE models, make the top level an architecture view: separate
  plant/power electronics from control/scenario/diagnostics, then connect those
  areas with named `Goto`/`From` tags or buses.
- Keep subsystem names short and conventional. Prefer names like `Power`,
  `Control`, `Diagnostics`, `Load`, `Plant`, or `Power_Electronics` over long
  descriptive names that clutter the top level.
- Validate before success: update diagram, run the minimum relevant
  simulation, compare plant-side gates, check legal switch states, and report
  numeric results.
- Ask for missing model data, logs, or GUI state when available tools cannot
  access them.

## Subskill Routing

- `subskills/three-phase-grid-inverter`: active SPWM/SVPWM, gate routing,
  waveform balance, VSG, PI/feedforward, and P/Q checks.
- Developing or stub subskills: use only as scope markers and evidence
  checklists.
- If the domain is ambiguous, classify by source/load, topology, control
  objective, and validation signals first.

## Boundary

- This skill does not manage OS-level schedulers, background jobs, or other
  system automation.
- This skill does not replace Simulink build/simulate/test skills; it adds
  PE-specific routing, evidence standards, and diagnostics.
- Keep downloaded corpora, generated models, caches, and long-loop outputs out
  of source control under `data/pe-loop/` or `data/generated-models/`.

## Reporting

Report root cause, changed paths, validation state, and remaining risks in the
user's language.
